# ðŸŽ¨ Tripti - Sinestesia

> A real-time audiovisual visualization experiment using OpenGL and serial input.  
> The screen is divided into three segments, each reacting dynamically with its own shader.

## ðŸ§  Concept

**Tripti - Sinestesia** is a digital installation that merges visual stimuli with physical data in three distinct zones: left, center, and right. Each area is driven by a separate GLSL shader, responding to live input from a serial device (e.g., Arduino), creating a visual form of *synesthesia*.
